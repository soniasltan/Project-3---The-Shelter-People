## Project Post Mortem

The Shelter People Post Mortem

#### Approach and Process

1. What in our process and approach to this project would we do differently next time?

Being aware of the requirements of the project
Potentially explore more libraries to accomplish same tasks (e.g. forms)

2. What in our process and approach to this project went well that we would repeat next time?

Starting early by discussing and bouncing off ideas at the start.
Standardising our ideas/expectations and having a project tracker to track what else is needed/completed.
### Pair programming was very fun! 11/10 would recommend and do it again. 
### Divide and conquer!!! Then finding different ways to solve a problem together and helping each other out.
Also setting designated roles for project leader/git manager/task manager was good for keeping each other accountable and on task.
Deployment and GitMerge is done daily so we know we are working on the most updated files and knowing our deployment is working.
Using markdown editor which made comments so much more fun!!

### Teamwork makes the dream work!!!!!!!

#### Code and Code Design

1. What in our code and program design in the project would we do differently next time?

We would implement check for the duplicated username/email.
Be careful about the syntaxes.

2. What in our code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything we would do the same next time?

SO NEAT not having huge chunks of code together - breaking sections out into different components helped to improve readability.

For each, please include code examples.

1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

#### SEI Post Mortem

1. What habits did we use during this unit that helped us?

Planning in advance (thanks ZY!)
Problem solving strategy, knowing what to google/search when we stumble upon an issue.

2. What habits did we have during this unit that we can improve on?

Stubbornly trying to make the frontend/backend sibiling deployment work was probably not super efficient, okay. 

3. How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)

Express was relatively straightforward, topics were easy to grasp and understand. 
Integrating the frontend and backend was more challenging.Seems fine, merging frontend/backend was challenging to get used to
